Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Birth of Software Engineering (1968 - NATO Conference)

The term "software engineering" was officially introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968. This milestone marked the recognition of software development as a structured engineering discipline rather than an ad-hoc coding activity.
It addressed the "software crisis," where projects were failing due to increasing complexity, poor management, and lack of formal methodologies.
2.The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s - 1980s)

Structured programming, championed by computer scientists like Edsger Dijkstra, introduced principles such as modular design, control structures (loops, conditionals), and the avoidance of "spaghetti code."
This approach improved software maintainability and readability, paving the way for methodologies like the Waterfall Model.
3.The Advent of Agile Development (2001 - Agile Manifesto)

In response to the limitations of rigid development models like Waterfall, a group of software experts introduced the Agile Manifesto in 2001.
Agile promotes flexibility, iterative development, customer collaboration, and responsiveness to change, leading to modern frameworks like Scrum, Kanban, and DevOps.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning

Defines project goals, scope, feasibility, resources, and timelines.
Helps in risk assessment and budget estimation.
2.Requirements Analysis

Gathers and documents functional and non-functional requirements from stakeholders.
Ensures clear understanding of user needs before development begins.
3.Design

Architects the software’s structure, including system design, database design, and UI/UX design.
Produces blueprints for developers to follow.
4.Implementation (Coding & Development)

Developers write the actual code based on design specifications.
Programming languages, frameworks, and tools are used to build the software.
5.Testing

Verifies the software’s functionality, performance, security, and usability.
Includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
6.Deployment

The tested software is released to production or end users.
May involve cloud deployment, server setup, or distribution through app stores.
7.Maintenance & Support

Involves bug fixes, updates, and improvements based on user feedback.
Ensures the software remains functional and secure over time.










Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Comparison of Waterfall and Agile Methodologies
Waterfall and Agile are two distinct approaches to software development, each suited to different project types and requirements.

Waterfall follows a linear, sequential process where each phase (planning, design, development, testing, and deployment) must be completed before moving to the next. It is rigid and best suited for projects with well-defined, stable requirements. Changes are difficult to accommodate once development begins. This methodology relies heavily on documentation and extensive upfront planning. Testing happens only after the development phase is complete.

In contrast, Agile is an iterative and flexible approach that focuses on incremental development. Work is done in short cycles called sprints, allowing for continuous improvements and adjustments based on client feedback. Agile promotes collaboration between teams and customers, with frequent testing and deployment throughout the process. It is ideal for projects where requirements may evolve over time.

Examples of Appropriate Scenarios
Waterfall is suitable for projects that require strict documentation and regulatory compliance, such as government systems, healthcare applications, and banking software. Since these projects have fixed requirements, a structured approach ensures stability and security.

Agile is better for dynamic projects, such as mobile app development, SaaS platforms, and e-commerce websites. These projects often require frequent updates and user-driven changes, making an iterative approach more effective.
